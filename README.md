# Dll Injector

This program can inject *.dll files into x64 or x86 programs on the fly. You can even inject multiple *.dlls and instances of the processes all at once. This program can also stop x64 injection into x86 and vice versa by checking *.dll and the process(es).

Features:

* x64 Support
* x86 Support
* Multi Injection
* Easy process finding
* Open Source
